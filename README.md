# TERIUS
Choi et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2018

**About TERIUS**
TERIUS is a program designed to differentiate between long non-coding RNAs and transcripts with coding potential or transcripts that are actually 3â€™UTR fragments of mRNAs. TERIUS distinguishes these transcripts using two-step filtration process from bona fide lncRNAs.

**Using TERIUS**
TERIUS is written using Python in Linux CentOS 6.0 environment. It requires Ribo-seq, UPF1 CLIP-seq and RNA-seq for high-throughput sequence data, and an annotation file of the transcripts in question in refFlat format.

**Citing TERIUS**
TERIUS is currently submitted for review. We will update this information once the paper in accepted for publication.
